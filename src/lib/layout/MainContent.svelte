	<h4 class="m-2 underline">OUR STORY</h4>
	<p class="m-1">
		jack’s Bar and Kitchen is the brainchild of Ryan and John McElhinney. We are located at 96
		Isabella Street (behind Southwark Tube) SE1 8DD. The original Jack’s was opened in Ireland in
		1970 by their father Jack so the boys decided to pay tribute to their father by re-opening the
		original almost forty years on. Jack's is a bar for birthdays, catching up with friends, lunch
		on our patio in our winter garden, craft beer, cocktails and delicious Thai food.
